The first file called 'instance_features.csv' is a random selection 
from the test data used for the above model predictions.

The other file called 'anchor_explantions.csv' contains the ANCHOR values/weiths
generated as an explainer for the selection of features in the 'instance_features.csv'
file.

The 'anchor_explantions.csv' contains the index of the instance features in the test data
and a text description of the ANCHOR explanations in the column named 'Anchor Explanation'.


Convert the dataframe 'new_df_anchor_results' into a new dataframe that represents a 
numerical conversion of the ANCHOR description in the column named 'Anchor Explanation'.

This new ANCHORS dataframe must contain corresponding rows to the feature dataframe 
'df_feature_instances' and contain a sequence of columns based on each instance
feature that represent a numerical conversion of the ANCHOR values for each featute instance.

The dataframe for the ANCHOR feature values must have a consistent number of columns per 
features so that a Eulidean distance calculation can be correctly carried out on any two 
instances in the ANCHOR feature values dataframe. In other words, each feature column must 
have a consistent number of corresponding column cells across all the instances in the ANCHOR
feature values dataframe.

Provide a column name in the ANCHORS dataframe output that relates in some way to the feature 
column in the feature instance dataframe to which the ANCHOR weight/value refers. Make allowances
for the format or the ANCHOR weight/values using '<', '>', and '='.


Each individual record in this numberical ANCHOR dataframe must uniquely match a single instance 
in the feature file.
