The first file called 'instance_features.csv' is a random selection 
from the test data used for the above model predictions.

The other file called 'anchor_explantions.csv' contains the ANCHOR values/weiths
generated as an explainer for the selection of features in the 'instance_features.csv'
file.

The 'anchor_explantions.csv' contains the index of the instance features in the test data
and a text description of the ANCHOR explanations in the column named 'Anchor Explanation'.


Convert this file into a new dataframe that represents a numerical conversion of the ANCHOR
description in the column named 'Anchor Explanation'.

The dataframe for the ANCHOR explanation values must have a consistent number of columns 
so that a Eulidean distance calculation can be correctly carried out on any two 
instances in the ANCHOR feature values dataframe, regardless of the nummber of weights in
the explanation. 

In other words, each column must have a consistent number of corresponding column cells 
across all the instances in the ANCHOR values dataframe. Each individual record in this 
numberical ANCHOR dataframe must uniquely match a single instance in the feature file.
