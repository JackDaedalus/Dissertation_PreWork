Generate a Python function that takes the first twenty instances from the 'df_encoded' 
dataframe and generates a single corresponding counterfactual (DiCE) explanation for each
original dataframe instance.

Store these counterfactual explanations in a seperate dataframe. 

Each instance in the original 'df_encoded' dataframe must have a corresponding counterfactual 
explanation at the matching index in the counterfactual dataframe.

The output from the function will be both dataframes.
 
 
 


--- Working with CC dataset ---


Write Python code that takes the first two instances from the 'df_encoded' dataframe 
we have created in this thread and generate a single corresponding counterfactual (DiCE) explanation 
for each original dataframe instance.

Visualise these counterfactuals in the Python Kuebflow Notebook.
