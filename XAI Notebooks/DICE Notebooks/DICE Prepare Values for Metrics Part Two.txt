Generate a Python function that takes the first twenty instances from the 'df_encoded' 
dataframe and generates a single corresponding counterfactual (DiCE) explanation for each
original dataframe instance.

Store these counterfactual explanations in a seperate dataframe. 

Each instance in the original 'df_encoded' dataframe must have a corresponding counterfactual 
explanation at the matching index in the counterfactual dataframe.

The output from the function will be both dataframes.
