Using this dataset generate the Python code to build an ML model for a binary classification problem 
to predict values of the 'default' target variables.  

Perform some basic feature engineering and perform one-hot encoding of categorical variables. Name the
encoded dataframe as 'df_encoded'.

Downsample the majority class to the same number of instances as the minority class. 

Suffix the training datasets with '_downsampled'.

Create a detection model based on an Artificial Neural Network. Apply the DiCE (Diverse Counterfactual 
Explanations) framework to generate Counterfactual explanations for the model behaviour.

Name the final model as 'model'.

Visualize the first five counterfactual explanations.
