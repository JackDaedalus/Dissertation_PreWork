Within a Python Kubeflow Notebook, I have used the tensorflow library to build a Machine Learning Data Science Neural Network model as part of a binary classification problem to predict fraud in a credit card dataset.

The 'keras_tuner' library was used to set up hyperparameter tuning with 50 trials and 10 epochs.


How can I present on screen details about; What is the architecture of the ANN? How many input layers are used? How many hidden layers are in the Neural Network created. What is the output? 
What kind of activation functions and learning rates were used? 

Can we display overall model parameters? what regularisation was used?
