Generate a Python function that takes the first twenty-five instances from the 'df_encoded' 
dataframe above and generates the SHAP Values explanations for each
original dataframe instance.

Store these SHAP values explanations in a seperate dataframe. 

Each instance in the original 'df_encoded' dataframe must have a corresponding SHAP value 
explanation at the matching index in the counterfactual dataframe.

The output from the function will both be dataframes.

Output the dataframes to seperate csv files.



Rewrite the above function so that a single dataframe and a single csv file for the shap values 
is always produced regardless of whether it is a positive or negative class. The rows in the 
dataframe produced by the function for the shap values must always correspond to the same 
instance row in the instance dataframe. 

That is, any given row in the instance dataframe has its shap value in the same row in the 
shap dataframe. The same logic applies to both csv files.
