Using this dataset generate the Python code to build an ML model for a binary classification problem to predict values of the 'default' target variables.  

Perform some basic feature engineering and perform one-hot encoding of categorical variables.

Downsample the majority class to the same number
of instances as the minority class. Split the data 70:30 for testing and training.

Suffix the training datasets with '_downsampled'.

Use a Random Forest algorithm and produce a very aesthically pleasing output of the performance
metrics of the model.

Name the final model as 'model'.
