The four spreadsheets just loaded each contain 20 results of custom evaluation metrics score listed under columns B through to F.

Each spreadsheet represents a different Machine Learning XAI technique, indicated by the name at the start of each spreadsheet.

For example, the SHAP technique results are stored in the file named 'SHAP_XAI_Metrics_Experiments Formatted cf v1-1 250324.xlsx'.

Perform a Friedman analysis, showing the steps of the workings in Python and detailed in the chat response, which outlines that statistical 
significance test across different evaluation metrics against the given XAI techniques (SHAP, LIME, ANCHORS and DiCE).

Display in a table the results of the Friedman Test of Significance, or not, between the XAI techniques when compared against the custom evaluation metrics.


Explain the output of the Friedman analysis table with useful bar chart graphs.


Explain the output of the Friedman analysis table with other useful visualisations.


Can we explain why the results for LIME were not statistically significant and thus inconclusive?



Run Wilcoxon signed-rank tests for pairwise comparisons between the XAI techniques for all the "XAI" metrics, with Bonferroni correction applied for multiple comparisons. 

Present the output in a full table (no summary) in the chat window and generate the associated Python code. 

Elaborate further on all the data presented in the Wilcoxon signed-rank tests in the chat ouput above, explaining what the table rows are telling us. 

Format the response as six sentences that would be appropriate for the 'Results' section of a MSc dissertation in Data Science.

In this explanation, is it possible with this Wilcoxon signed rank test to determine a ranking of each XAI technique based on these custom metrics, and establish which XAI technique is 'the best'?

Explain in one sentence, how and why the Bonferroni correction is applied for multiple comparisons in the above analysis

Explain again in the purpose and meaning of the values for 'Statistic' and 'p-Value' in the Wilcoxon signed-rank test tabular output above. Format the response as two sentences that would be 
appropriate for the 'Results' section of a MSc dissertation in Data Science.
