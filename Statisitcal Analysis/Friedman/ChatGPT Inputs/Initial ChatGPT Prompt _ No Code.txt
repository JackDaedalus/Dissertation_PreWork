The attached file contains a comparison of four XAI methods SHAP, LIME, ANCHORS, and DiCE, which are the column headings
in the attached spreadsheet in column 'B' to 'E'.

I need to conduct a non-parametric Friedman test to test the NULL hypothesis that there is no significant difference between
SHAP, LIME, ANCHORS, and DiCE based on the numbers captured in rows 2 to 6 for each column.

The rows 2 to 6 represent different measures applied to each XAI method. The names for the different measures are in column 'A'.

Assume that the Level of significant is 0.05.

First, explain if it is necessary to normalise this data for a Friedman test like this? Are any other data manipulation processes recommended?

Second, make a determination if the Friedman test shows if there is no significant difference between the dependent variables, 
or if it supports the Alternative Hypothesis. Display the calculated P value.

Third, provide a tabular breakdown of descriptive statistics across the four XAI methods. Then provide a tabular ouput of the key
statistics generated by the Friedman test.

Fourth, generate both a Box Plot and a Violinen Plot of the results and explain clearly in detail what the graphs are depicting. Provide a 
detailed elaboration of this graphical output.

--------------------------------------


Generate Python code, for use in a Python Kubeflow Notebook, that implements the above Friedman analysis and particularly
generates the tabular and graphical output of the analysis.

Ensure each line of code is commented with detailed explanations of what is happening, and that reflects the text in the previous analysis.



--------------------------------------


Using the above data, apply a Wilcoxon signedrank test, to be applied pairwise on the four XAI methods to measure the
scale of difference, if any, in performance between each method.

Provide tabular and graphical outputs at each relevant stage of the test and elaborate at length on 
what result this test is explaining. Provide a multi-sentence elaboration on the purpose of the 'Statistic' and 'p-value' column
values in the context of this particular test.


--------------------------------------


Generate Python code, for use in a Python Kubeflow Notebook, that implements the above Wilcoxon signedrank test and particularly
generates the tabular and graphical output of the analysis.

Ensure each line of code is commented with detailed explanations of what is happening, and that reflects the text in the previous analysis.

Ensure that the tabular data is as aesthetically pleasing as possible.

Generate the matrix of XAI methods and p-values.
