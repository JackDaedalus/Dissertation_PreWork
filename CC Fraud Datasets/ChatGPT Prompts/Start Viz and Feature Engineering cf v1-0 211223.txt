--- Columns with missing data ---

I want to use this loaded dataset in a machine learning Kubeflow Python Notebook to build a credti card fraud neural network detection model. 
This is a data analytics classification problem, and the target label is the column 'fraud'. To start the process I want Python code to identify
columns with more than 75% of the data missing.


Add Python code to update missing enties in the 'Secure3d' column with a 'U' character values.

Add Python code to update missing enties in the 'DvcPosEntryMode' column with a 'U' character values.


Add code to remove any columns with more than 75% missing values

Add code to rmove any rows still with missing data in the dataframe


--- Columns with only one data  value ---

Add code to identify if there are columns in the dataset where the values are the same in every cell. 
Output this analysis to and an asthetically pleasing output table. Then add code to remove those columns from the origonal dataframe, 
which we will now name 'df'.
