The file just loaded contains the result of a machine learning experiment on a credit card fraud predicitive classification model 
comparing four XAI methods (shap, lime, dice and anchor) against custom metrics: Identity, Stability, Seperability, Similarity, and 
Comp_Efficiency.

The first column of the loaded dataframe will contain the name of the metric. The next four columns have the name of the XAI method and
the scores against each metric.


Focus on plotting the density plots of values received from test samples across all 4 methods (shap, lime, dice and anchor). 
Display these density plots in this chat session by creating a matrix of graphs for the comparison, making sure that the legends used in the
graphs are clearly distinguished by different bright colours. Present this output in a very aesthetically 
pleasing output in both this chat and trough Python code.

Provide a commentary on the data represented in these density plots with five sentence descriptions that would be appropriate for a Data Science 
Masters dissertation, with very particular reference to the XAI method metrics results.


On top of that calculate the the Cohen-d among the four XAI methods to quantify the difference. Present this output in a very aesthetically 
pleasing output in both this chat and through Python code.

Provide a commentary on all steps with sentence descriptions that would be appropriate for a Data Science Masters dissertation. Generate three
sentences that explain the purpose of the Cohen's d analysis in this context.

Provide the Python code to implement all the above steps. Ensure the code is exhaustively commented.
