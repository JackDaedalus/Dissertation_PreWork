The attached file contains a comparison output from Machine Learning Data Science experiments of four XAI methods SHAP, LIME, ANCHORS, and DiCE, 
which are the column headings in the attached spreadsheet in column 'B' to 'E'.

I need to conduct a non-parametric Friedman test to test the NULL hypothesis that there is no significant difference between SHAP, LIME, ANCHORS, 
and DiCE based on the numbers captured in rows 2 to 6 for each column.

The rows 2 to 6 represent different measures applied to each XAI method. The names for the different measures are in column 'A'.

Assume that the Level of significant is 0.05.

First, explain why a Friedman test would be appropriate in this instance, mentioning the use of non-parametric tests on data which is not normally distributed, 
if relevant. Provide this output in three sentences suitable for inclusion in a Masters Data Science dissertation.








Second, explain if it is necessary to normalise this data for a Friedman test like this? Are any other data manipulation processes recommended?

Third, make a determination if the Friedman test shows if there is no significant difference between the dependent variables, 
or if it supports the Alternative Hypothesis. Display the calculated P value.

Fourth, provide a tabular breakdown of descriptive statistics across the four XAI methods. Then provide a tabular ouput of the key
statistics generated by the Friedman test.




Fifth, generate both a Box Plot and a Violin Plot of the results and explain clearly in detail what the graphs are depicting, in terms of a visual 
representation of distribution of scores for each XAI method. Provide a detailed elaboration of this graphical output, which is three sentences 
per graph suitable for inclusion in a Masters Data Science dissertation.

Provide the Python code that implements these graphs.


The source data in the file 'XAI_StatTest2_RowLables_v1.xlsx' is not normalised, because it does not need to be for the Friedman test. 
However, to make the graphs more readable, write Python code to normalise the content of 'XAI_StatTest2_RowLables_v1.xlsx' and produce 
both a Box Plot and a Violin Plot of the results and explain clearly in detail what the graphs are depicting, in terms of a visual 
representation of distribution of scores for each XAI method. Provide a detailed elaboration of this graphical output, which is three sentences 
per graph suitable for inclusion in a Masters Data Science dissertation.

Also, reproduce the graphs in the chat window.
