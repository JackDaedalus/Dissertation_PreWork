LIME Prompts


Using this dataset, which has a target variable of 'default', generate Python code for a Kubelfow Notebook to generate a 
binary classification model using a Random Forest algorithm to predict future fraud.

Apply useful Machine Learning feature engineering to the dataset and balance the dataset 50:50 between classification targets.

Apply Cross validation techniques to tune the hyperparameters of the Radom Forest algorithm.

Generate a series of metrics on model performance. Please the metrics into a seperate dataframe and then present
this output in a very aesth8ically pleasing manner using the dataframe.

Once the model has been created generate LIME values for the first 10 instances in the Test dataset. Ensure every line of Python code 
is clearly commented with a description of what operations are taking place, and why.

Print the output of key results in an easy-to-read format.

Provide a narrative of what the LIME values are telling the user about three random instances, one of which has a target default value of '1' 
and the other two being '0'.
