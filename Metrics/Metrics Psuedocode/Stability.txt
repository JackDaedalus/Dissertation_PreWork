"Stability" - this metric states that instances belonging to the same class must have comparable explanations

- Assume that the dataset has been balanced 50:50 for fraud/non-fraud.
- Cluster explanations of all instances in test data by k-means, include the 'predicted fraud' label.
- Number of clusters equals label values, in this case two (fraud/non-fraud)
- For each instance in test data
	- compare explanation cluster label to predicted class label
	- if match, then stability satisfied
	
	alternatively
	
	- compare explanation cluster label in largest cluster to predicted class label
	- Take ratio of majority predicted class label to minority class as the stability measure (the higher the value the closer the explanation clusters map to predicted results).	
	
Question: how do we know which explanations cluster equates to 'fraud' and which cluster equates to 'non-fraud'? If dataset is a 50:50 label split and we use two clusters then 
we can just pick one cluster (use the largest).
