"Seperability" - two dissimilar instances muat have dissimilar explanations

 - Choose subset S of test data
		
		-  ensure no duplicates instances exist. This is a comparison of features, as no explanations have been generated yet.
		-  remove any instances with duplicated features
		-  generate explanations for each remaining instance in the subset of test data
		
 - For every instance in S
 
		- compare explanations with all other instance explanations
		- if no duplicates are found; mark instance as 'success'


This metric tends to score high. Maybe consider a small tolerance when checking explanations for duplicates.
