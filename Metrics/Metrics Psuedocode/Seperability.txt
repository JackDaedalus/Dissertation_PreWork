"Seperability" - two dissimilar instances muat have dissimilar explanations

Take subset of test data and determine for each individual instance the number of duplicate
explanations in entire subset, if any.

To measure the separability metric, we choose a subset S of the testing data set that has no duplicates and get
their explanations. Then for every instance s in S, we compare its explanation with all other explanations
of instances in S and if such explanation has no duplicate then it satisfies the separability metric.



 - Choose subset S of test data
		
		-  ensure no duplicate instances exist. This is a comparison of features, 
		   as no explanations have been generated yet.
		-  remove any instances with duplicated features
		-  generate explanations for each remaining instance in the subset of test data
		
 - For every instance in S
 
		- compare explanations with all other instance explanations
		- if no duplicates are found; mark instance as 'success'


This metric tends to score high. Maybe consider a small tolerance when checking explanations for duplicates.
