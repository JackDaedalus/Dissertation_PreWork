"Identity"
- Start with first instance in test data
- Search the remaining instances in test data and calculate distance from first instance
- Select first instance with zero distance, if any
- Generate explanations for both instances
- Calculate distance between both instance explanations
- Generate success if explanation distance is equal to zero
- Drop first instance from test data
- Repeat with second instance until end of test data instances
- Calculate rate of explanation distance = zero / instance feature distance = zero

OR  (Go with this one!)

- Start with first instance in test data
- Search all other instances in test data and calculate distance from first instance (feature distance)
- Select closest other instance to first instance, i
- Generate explanations for all instances in test data
- Calculate distance of first instance explanations from explanations in all other instances
- Select closest other instance to first instance (explanation distance), t
- Generate success if instance id (i) = instance id (t)
- Drop first instance from test data
