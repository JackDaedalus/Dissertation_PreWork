Identity Function Output for ChatGPT


1. For each instance � t in the feature dataframe, compute the Euclidean distance to all other instances and identify the next nearest instance 
� i.
2. In parallel, for the corresponding SHAP values of instance � t, compute the Euclidean distance to all other SHAP values and identify the nearest instance.
3. Check if the row numbers identified in steps 1 and 2 match.
4. Count the number of matches.
5. Compute the percentage of matches.

Here's the Python function for the Kubeflow Notebook:


from scipy.spatial import distance

def match_percentage(features_df, shap_values_df):
    # Ensure the dataframes have the same number of rows
    assert len(features_df) == len(shap_values_df), "Dataframes must have the same number of rows"
    
    # Initialize a counter for matches
    match_count = 0
    
    # Iterate over each instance (t) in the feature dataframe
    for t in range(len(features_df)):
        # Compute Euclidean distances from instance (t) to all other instances in the feature dataframe
        feature_distances = distance.cdist(features_df.iloc[[t], 1:], features_df.drop(columns='Row_Count'), metric='euclidean')
        
        # Identify the row number of the next nearest instance (i) in terms of feature distance
        # We use [1] to get the second nearest instance since the nearest is the instance itself (distance = 0)
        nearest_feature_row = features_df.iloc[feature_distances.argsort()[0][1]]['Row_Count']
        
        # Compute Euclidean distances from SHAP values of instance (t) to all other SHAP values
        shap_distances = distance.cdist(shap_values_df.iloc[[t], 1:], shap_values_df.drop(columns='Row_Count'), metric='euclidean')
        
        # Identify the row number of the nearest instance in terms of SHAP value distance
        nearest_shap_row = shap_values_df.iloc[shap_distances.argsort()[0][1]]['Row_Count']
        
        # Check if the nearest feature instance and nearest SHAP value instance have the same row number
        if nearest_feature_row == nearest_shap_row:
            match_count += 1

        # Print the current iteration and match count for debugging purposes
        print(f"Checked instance {t+1}/{len(features_df)}. Current matches: {match_count}")

    # Calculate the percentage of matches
    match_percentage = (match_count / len(features_df)) * 100
    print(f"Match Percentage: {match_percentage:.2f}%")
    
    return match_percentage

# Call the function to see the results
match_percentage(features_df, shap_values_df)


This function will compute the percentage of matches where the nearest feature instance and nearest SHAP value instance have the same row number. 
The function prints the match percentage in the "xx.xx%" format before returning the value.







Sure, I'll add a print statement for debugging that shows the distance between instance t and i for each feature 
and SHAP value instance calculation. Here's the modified function:


from scipy.spatial import distance

def match_percentage(features_df, shap_values_df):
    # Ensure the dataframes have the same number of rows
    assert len(features_df) == len(shap_values_df), "Dataframes must have the same number of rows"
    
    # Initialize a counter for matches
    match_count = 0
    
    # Iterate over each instance (t) in the feature dataframe
    for t in range(len(features_df)):
        # Compute Euclidean distances from instance (t) to all other instances in the feature dataframe
        feature_distances = distance.cdist(features_df.iloc[[t], 1:], features_df.drop(columns='Row_Count'), metric='euclidean')
        
        # Identify the row number of the next nearest instance (i) in terms of feature distance
        # We use [1] to get the second nearest instance since the nearest is the instance itself (distance = 0)
        nearest_feature_index = feature_distances.argsort()[0][1]
        nearest_feature_row = features_df.iloc[nearest_feature_index]['Row_Count']
        nearest_feature_distance = feature_distances[0][nearest_feature_index]
        
        # Compute Euclidean distances from SHAP values of instance (t) to all other SHAP values
        shap_distances = distance.cdist(shap_values_df.iloc[[t], 1:], shap_values_df.drop(columns='Row_Count'), metric='euclidean')
        
        # Identify the row number of the nearest instance in terms of SHAP value distance
        nearest_shap_index = shap_distances.argsort()[0][1]
        nearest_shap_row = shap_values_df.iloc[nearest_shap_index]['Row_Count']
        nearest_shap_distance = shap_distances[0][nearest_shap_index]
        
        # Check if the nearest feature instance and nearest SHAP value instance have the same row number
        if nearest_feature_row == nearest_shap_row:
            match_count += 1
        
        # Print distances and current matches for debugging purposes
        print(f"Instance {t+1}: Feature Distance: {nearest_feature_distance:.4f}, SHAP Value Distance: {nearest_shap_distance:.4f}")
        print(f"Checked instance {t+1}/{len(features_df)}. Current matches: {match_count}")

    # Calculate the percentage of matches
    match_percentage = (match_count / len(features_df)) * 100
    print(f"Match Percentage: {match_percentage:.2f}%")
    
    return match_percentage

# Call the function to see the results
match_percentage(features_df, shap_values_df)



The added print statement shows the Euclidean distance between the current instance t and the nearest instance i for both the features and SHAP values. 
This will provide insights into the distances that the function is computing during its execution.
