"Computational Efficiency" 

 - Use a standard comptuational framework - an identical cloud instance for each explanation process
 
 - Use a consistent sample from the test data set for each explanation process
 
 - Measure time taken by the interpretability framework to output an explanation
 
 - Reason for importance of this metric;
 
		- The metrics relates to the 'comptuational complexity' of the interpretability framework, which is important to consider in terms of feasibilty
		- Computational time can be a bottleneck in generating explanations and may have an impact on the commercial viability of an explainability process
