"Similarity" - thia metric states that the more similar the instances to be explained, the closer their explanations should be and vice versa.

 - Normalise instances in the test data, before explanations generated (DBSCAN)
 
 - cluster instances in test data into two clusters (fraud/non-fraud)
 
 - generate explanations for each instance
 
 - normalise the explanations
 
 - calculate mean pairwise Euclidean distance between explanations of test data in each cluster (fraud/non-fraud)
 
 - the smaller the value the better
 
 - normalise the end results across all explanation processes before evaluating significance
