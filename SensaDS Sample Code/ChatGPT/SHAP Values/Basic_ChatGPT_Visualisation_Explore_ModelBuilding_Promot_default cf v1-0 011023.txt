Generate some interesting visuals from this dataset. 

Also make recommendations on what Machine Learning routines would have to be applied to this dataset in order to generate a binary classification model 
based on the target feature of 'default' and using a Random Forest algorithm. 

Implement these recommendations in Python code that would be inserted in a Pythin Notebook.

After those recommendations, generate the python code that would feature engineer this dataset, use a 70:30 split for training and test data, 
and create a predictive ML model with RF. 

Generate some model metrics to show performance of model on the test data. Make the presentation of those metrics as aesthetically pleasing and 
as easy to read as possible via the python code output, replicating how a Python code notebook would generate such output.
