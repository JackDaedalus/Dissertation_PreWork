Here's what the code does:

Load the dataset.
Set up pycaret with the necessary configuration, including feature selection.
Compare different models and select the best one based on accuracy.
Evaluate the model for different accuracy metrics.
Generate SHAP values for the model.
Extract and display the top 30 features based on their SHAP values.


Remember to replace 'your_dataset_path_here.csv' with the actual path to your dataset. 
Before executing, ensure you have installed the necessary libraries. For this code, you'll mainly need to install pycaret:


pip install pycaret


This should automatically handle most dependencies. Ensure that you've set up a virtual environment or similar to manage dependencies effectively.
