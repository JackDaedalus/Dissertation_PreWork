To what extent can we quantify the quality of
contemporary machine learning interpretability
techniques, providing local, model-agnostic, and
post-hoc explanations, in the classification of credit
card fraud transactions by a ‘black box’ Neural
Network ML model?




Quantifying the quality of machine learning interpretability techniques, especially for tasks like credit card fraud detection using 'black box' neural network models, 
is a multifaceted problem. Let's break it down by first understanding the terminologies:

1. **Local explanations:** These provide insights for individual predictions rather than the model as a whole.
2. **Model-agnostic explanations:** These are methods that aim to explain any model's predictions rather than being tailored for a specific type of model.
3. **Post-hoc explanations:** These are methods applied after a model has been trained, as opposed to during training.

To quantify the quality of interpretability techniques, consider the following aspects:

1. **Faithfulness:** Does the explanation accurately reflect the behavior of the model for the given instance?
   
2. **Consistency:** Across similar instances or slight perturbations, does the explanation change in a reasonable and understandable manner?

3. **Comprehensibility:** Is the explanation easy to understand for stakeholders, including domain experts, model developers, and possibly end-users?

4. **Coverage:** Does the method provide insights for a wide range of model predictions, or is it limited to certain areas of the decision space?

5. **Granularity:** Can the method provide both high-level and detailed explanations if needed?

6. **Computational Efficiency:** How resource-intensive is the interpretability method?

7. **Generality:** Does the method work for various model architectures and datasets?



In the context of credit card fraud transactions using neural networks:

1. **Relevance:** It's crucial that the explanations reflect features and aspects that are pertinent to fraud detection. 
For instance, large transactions made in a foreign country shortly after a small local transaction might be suspicious.

2. **Actionability:** Stakeholders like financial analysts need to be able to act upon the explanations. 
A good explanation would provide insights that can lead to direct interventions or further investigations.

3. **Evaluation Metrics:** While traditionally model performance might be evaluated using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and the AUC-ROC curve, 
interpretability evaluation can be more subjective. Qualitative evaluation, like user studies, can help understand the value of interpretability techniques.


Quantifying the quality of these explanations can be done through:

1. **User Studies:** Observing how domain experts react to and make decisions based on the explanations can provide insights into their effectiveness.
   
2. **Simulated Experiments:** For example, you might intentionally train a model with biases and see if your interpretability method can detect and explain them.

3. **Direct Quantitative Measures:** Some methods, like LIME or SHAP, have their own metrics or criteria to evaluate the quality of explanations.

In summary, while quantifying the quality of machine learning interpretability techniques can be challenging, 
a combination of quantitative and qualitative methods, grounded in the context of the application (like credit card fraud detection), can provide a comprehensive assessment.
